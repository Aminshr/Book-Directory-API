# ðŸ“š Book Directory API - Spring Boot REST Service

A comprehensive REST API for managing a book collection, built with Java and Spring Boot. This application demonstrates modern API development practices including proper endpoint design, data validation, authentication, and documentation.

This project serves as both a functional book management system and a reference implementation for RESTful API best practices.

## Features

- CRUD operations for books (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Pagination support
- Search by author or genre
- Basic authentication
- Swagger UI documentation
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

## API Endpoints

  - Optional query parameters:
    - `page` - Page number (0-based)
    - `size` - Page size
    - `author` - Filter by author

2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
4. Access the API at `http://localhost:8080/books`
5. Access Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`
6. Access H2 Console at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` (JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:bookdb`, Username: `sa`, Password: `password`)
